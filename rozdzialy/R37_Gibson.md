# Top pięć ćwiczeń ze spóźnionego czytania ze zrozumieniem - numer siedem - Gibson

Pierwszy raz zajrzałem do wydanego kiedy miałem roczek *The Ecological Approach to Visual
Perception* Gibsona jakiś tydzień albo dwa tygodnie temu. A więc siedem miesięcy po tym, jak
zacząłem pisać tą książkę, a dwadzieścia lat po tym, jak zacząłem pisać pracę doktorską dotyczącą
teoretycznych podstaw psychologii, w której od pewnego momentu opierałem się głównie na obserwacji,
że każde zachowanie jako takie to działanie celowe, a każde działanie celowe jako takie jest
przybliżonym rozwiązaniem jakiegoś zadania, wobec czego psychologia naukowa powinna polegać przede
wszystkim na rozwijaniu teorii ogólnych własności zadań.

Od tego czasu miałem dokładnie dwa równie dobre moim zdaniem wglądy, to jest obserwację, że dla
psychologa środowisko jest układem powiązanych zadań i niedawny wgląd, że funkcje rozumiane jako
role w rozwiązaniach zadań są z konieczności relatywne do punktu widzenia i nieunikalne.

I teraz nie wiem, czy źle się stało, że do Gibsona zajrzałem tak późno, czy może jednak to
spóźnienie nie było wcale takie złe.

*Introduction*:

> In this book, environment will refer to the surroundings of those organisms that perceive and
> behave, that is to say, animals. The environment of plants, organisms that lack sense organs and
> muscles, is not relevant in the study of perception and behavior. We shall treat the veget ation
> of the world as animals do, as if it were lumped together with the inor ganic minerals of the
> world, with the physical, chem ical, and geological environment. Plants in general are not
> animate; they do not move about, they do not behave, they lack a nervous system, and they do not
> have sensations. In these respects they are like the objects of physics, chem istry, and
> geology.

> Biology begins with the divi sion between the nonliving and the living. But psychology begins with
> the division between the inanimate and the animate, and this is where we choose to begin. (s. 3)

> The environ ment consists of the surroundings of animals. Let us observe that in one sense the
> surround ings of a single animal are the same as the surroundings of all animals but that in
> another sense the surround ings of a single animal are different from those of any other
> animal. (s. 3)

> The fact is worth remem ber ing because it is often neglected that the words animal and
> environment make an inseparable pair.  Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without
> an environment surround ing it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environ ment implies an
> animal (or at least an organism) to be surrounded.

> The mutual ity of animal and envir on ment is not implied by physics and the physical
> sciences. The basic concepts of space, time, matter, and energy do not lead naturally to the
> organism- environ ment concept or to the concept of a species and its habitat. Instead, they seem
> to lead to the idea of an animal as an extremely complex object of the physical world. The animal
> is thought of as a highly organized part of the phys ical world but still a part and still an
> object. This way of thinking neglects the fact that the animal- object is surrounded in a special
> way, that an envir on ment is ambient for a living object in a different way from the way that a
> set of objects is ambient for a phys ical object. The term physical environ ment is, therefore,
> apt to get us mixed up, and it will usually be avoided in this book.
>
> Every animal is, in some degree at least, a perceiver and a behaver. It is sentient and animate,
> to use old-fashioned terms. It is a perceiver of the environment and a behaver in the environ
> ment. But this is not to say that it perceives the world of physics and behaves in the space and
> time of physics. (s. 4)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Units of the Environment*:

> Now, with respect to these units, an essential point of theory must be emphas ized. The smaller
> units are embedded in the larger units by what I will call nesting. For example, canyons are
> nested within mountains; trees are nested within canyons; leaves are nested within trees; and
> cells are nested within leaves. There are forms within forms both up and down the scale of
> size. Units are nested within larger units. Things are components of other things. They would
> constitute a hier archy except that this hierarchy is not categor ical but full of transitions and
> overlaps. . Hence, for the terrestrial environment, there is no special proper unit in terms of
> which it can be analyzed once and for all. There are no atomic units of the world considered as an
> envir on ment. Instead, there are subordin ate and superordin ate units. (s. 5)

> The acts of animals them selves, like the events of the environ ment they perceive, can be
> described at various levels, as subordinate and superordinate acts. (s. 8)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Permanence and Change of the
Layout*:

> An observer can recog nize the same room on different occa sions while perceiving the change of
> arrangement, or the same child at different ages while noticing her growth. The permanence
> underlies the change.
>
> Permanence is relative, of course; that is, it depends on whether you mean persistence over a day,
> a year, or a millennium. Almost nothing is forever perman ent; nothing is either immutable or
> mutable. So it is better to speak of persistence under change. The “perman ent objects” of the
> world, which are of so much concern to psychologists and philosophers, are actu ally only objects
> that persist for a very long time.
>
> The abstract notion of invariance and variance in mathem atics is related to what is meant by
> persistence and change in the envir on ment. There are variants and invariants in any trans
> formation, constants and vari ables. Some properties are conserved and others not conserved. The
> same words are not used by all writers (for example, Piaget, 1969), but there is a common core of
> meaning in all such pairs of terms. The point to be noted is that for persistence and change, for
> invariant and variant, each term of the pair is reciprocal to the other. (s. 8-9)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Persistence in the Environment*

> The same would be true if a shaped object disinteg rated, chan ging from solid to granular. The
> object does not persist, but the matter does. Ecology calls this a nonpersistence, a destruc tion
> of the object, whereas physics calls it a mere change of state. Both asser tions are correct, but
> the former is more relevant to the behavior of animals and children. (s. 9)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Motion in the Environment*

> So different, in fact, are envir on mental motions from those studied by Isaac Newton that it is
> best to think of them as changes of struc ture rather than changes of position of elementary
> bodies, changes of form rather than of point locations, or changes in the layout rather than
> motions in the usual meaning of the term. (s. 10)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Summary*:

> The envir on ment of animals and men is what they perceive. The environment is not the same as the
> physical world, if one means by that the world described by physics.
>
> The observer and his envir on ment are complementary. So are the set of observers and their common
> environment.
>
> The components and events of the environ ment fall into natural units. These units are
> nested. They should not be confused with the metric units of space and time.
>
> The environment persists in some respects and changes in other respects. The most radical change
> is going out of existence or coming into existence. (s. 11)

*The Environment to be Perceived* / *Medium, Substances, Surfaces* / *The Properties of the Atmosphere*:

> To sum up, the char acter ist ics of an environmental medium are that it affords respir ation or
> breathing; it permits locomotion; it can be fi lled with illumination so as to permit vision; it
> allows detec tion of vibra tions and detection of diffusing emanations; it is homogeneous; and fi
> nally, it has an absolute axis of reference, up and down. All these offer ings of nature, these
> possib ilities or oppor tunities, these *affordances* as I will call them, are invariant. They
> have been strik ingly constant throughout the whole evolution of animal life. (s. 14-15)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances*:

> I have described the environ ment as the surfaces that separ ate substances from the medium in
> which the animals live. But I have also described what the environ ment affords animals, mention
> ing the terrain, shelters, water, fire, objects, tools, other animals, and human displays. How do
> we go from surfaces to affordances? And if there is information in light for the perception of
> surfaces, is there information for the perception of what they afford? Perhaps the composition and
> layout of surfaces constitute what they afford. If so, to perceive them is to perceive what they
> afford. This is a radical hypothesis, for it implies that the “values” and “mean ings” of things
> in the environ ment can be directly perceived. Moreover, it would explain the sense in which
> values and meanings are external to the perceiver. (s. 119)

> The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes,
> either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, but the noun affordance is
> not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environ ment and the animal
> in a way that no exist ing term does. It implies the complemxuntarity of the animal and the
> environment. [...]
>
> If a terrestrial surface is nearly horizontal (instead of slanted), nearly fl at (instead of
> convex or concave), and sufficiently extended (relat ive to the size of the animal) and if its
> substance is rigid (relat ive to the weight of the animal), then the surface affords support. It
> is a surface of support, and we call it a substratum, ground, or floor. It is stand- on-able,
> permitting an upright posture for quad rupeds and bipeds. It is therefore walk-on-able and
> run-over-able. It is not sink-into-able like a surface of water or a swamp, that is, not for heavy
> terrestrial animals. Support for water bugs is different. (s. 119)
>
> Note that the four proper ties listed—horizontal, flat, extended, and rigid would be physical
> proper ties of a surface if they were meas ured with the scales and stand ard units used in
> physics. As an afford ance of support for a species of animal, however, they have to be measured
> relat ive to the animal. They are unique for that animal. They are not just abstract physical
> properties. They have unity relative to the posture and behavior of the animal being considered.
> So an affordance cannot be measured as we measure in physics. (s. 120)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *The Niches of the
Environment*:

> Ecologists have the concept of a niche. A species of animal is said to utilize or occupy a certain
> niche in the environment. This is not quite the same as the habitat of the species; a niche refers
> more to how an animal lives than to where it lives. I suggest that a niche is a set of
> affordances. (s. 120)
>
> The natural environ ment offers many ways of life, and different animals have differ ent ways of
> life. The niche implies a kind of animal, and the animal implies a kind of niche. Note the
> complementarity of the two. (s. 120)

> An import ant fact about the afford ances of the environ ment is that they are in a sense
> objective, real, and phys ical, unlike values and mean ings, which are often supposed to be
> subjective, phenomenal, and mental. But, actu ally, an afford ance is neither an objective
> property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the
> dichotomy of subjective objective and helps us to under stand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact
> of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psych ical, yet neither. An
> afford ance points both ways, to the environ ment and to the observer.
>
> The niche for a certain species should not be confused with what some animal psychologists have
> called the phenomenal environment of the species. This can be taken erroneously to be the “private
> world” in which the species is supposed to live, the “subject ive world,” or the world of
> “consciousness.” The behavior of observers depends on their perception of the environ ment, surely
> enough, but this does not mean that their behavior depends on a so-called private or subject ive
> or conscious environment. The organ ism depends on its environ ment for its life, but the
> environment does not depend on the organ ism for its existence. (s. 121)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Man's Alteration of the
Natural Environment*:

> In the last few thou sand years, as everybody now realizes, the very face of the earth has been
> modified by man. (s. 121)

> Why has man changed the shapes and substances of his environment? To change what it affords
> him. He has made more avail able what benefits him and less press ing what injures him. In making
> life easier for himself, of course, he has made life harder for most of the other animals. Over
> the millennia, he has made it easier for himself to get food, easier to keep warm, easier to see
> at night, easier to get about, and easier to train his offspring.  This is not a new environment -
> an artificial environment distinct from the natural environment—but the same old environment
> modified by man. It is a mistake to separate the natural from the arti ficial as if there were two
> environments; arti facts have to be manu factured from natural substances.  It is also a mistake
> to separ ate the cultural environment from the natural environment, as if there were a world of
> mental products distinct from the world of material products. There is only one world, however
> diverse, and all animals live in it, although we human animals have altered it to suit ourselves.
> We have done so wastefully, thought lessly, and, if we do not mend our ways, fatally. (s. 122)

> Orthodox psychology asserts that we perceive these objects insofar as we discriminate their proper
> ties or qualities. Psychologists carry out elegant exper iments in the labor atory to find out how
> and how well these qual it ies are discriminated. The psychologists assume that objects are
> composed of their qualities. But I now suggest that what we perceive when we look at objects are
> their affordances, not their qual it ies. We can discrim inate the dimensions of difference if
> required to do so in an experi ment, but what the object affords us is what we normally pay
> attention to. The special combin ation of qual it ies into which an object can be analyzed is
> ordinarily not noticed. (s. 125-126)

> Phenomenal objects are not built up of qual it ies; it is the other way around. The affordance of
> an object is what the infant begins by noticing. The meaning is observed before the substance and
> surface, the color and form, are seen as such. An afford ance is an invari ant combin ation of
> vari ables, and one might guess that it is easier to perceive such an invari ant unit than it is
> to perceive all the vari ables separ ately. It is never necessary to distinguish all the features
> of an object and, in fact, it would be impossible to do so. Perception is econom ical. (s. 126)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *To Perceive an Affordance
is not to Classify an Object*:

> The fact that a stone is a missile does not imply that it cannot be other things as well. It can
> be a paperweight, a bookend, a hammer, or a pendulum bob. It can be piled on another rock to make
> a cairn or a stone wall. These affordances are all consistent with one another. The differences
> between them are not clear-cut, and the arbitrary names by which they are called do not count for
> perception. If you know what can be done with a graspable detached object, what it can be used
> for, you can call it whatever you please. 
>
> The theory of affordances rescues us from the philosophical muddle of assuming fixed classes of
> objects, each defined by its common features and then given a name. As Ludwig Wittgenstein knew,
> you cannot specify the necessary and sufficient features of the class of things to which a name is
> given. They have only a “family resemblance.”  But this does not mean you cannot learn how to use
> things and perceive their uses. You do not have to classify and label things in order to perceive
> what they afford. (s. 126)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Other Persons and Animals*:

> The richest and most elabor ate afford ances of the environment are provided by other animals and,
> for us, other people. These are, of course, detached objects with topologically closed surfaces,
> but they change the shape of their surfaces while yet retain ing the same funda mental shape. They
> move from place to place, changing the postures of their bodies, ingest ing and emitting certain
> substances, and doing all this spontaneously, initi ating their own move ments, which is to say
> that their movements are animate. These bodies are subject to the laws of mech anics and yet not
> subject to the laws of mechan ics, for they are not governed by these laws. They are so differ ent
> from ordin ary objects that infants learn almost immedi ately to distinguish them from plants and
> nonliv ing things. When touched they touch back, when struck they strike back; in short, they
> interact with the observer and with one another. Behavior affords behavior, and the whole subject
> matter of psychology and of the social sciences can be thought of as an elab oration of this basic
> fact. Sexual behavior, nurtur ing behavior, fighting behavior, cooperat ive behavior, economic
> behavior, political behavior all depend on the perceiving of what another person or other persons
> afford, or sometimes on the misperceiving of it. (s. 126-127)

*The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Places and Hiding Places*

> The habitat of a given animal contains places. A place is not an object with definite boundaries
> but a region (Chapter 3). The different places of a habitat may have different affordances. Some
> are places where food is usually found and others where it is not. There are places of danger,
> such as the brink of a cliff and the regions where pred ators lurk. There are places of refuge
> from predators. Among these is the place where mate and young are, the home, which is usually a
> partial enclosure. Animals are skilled at what the psychologist calls place-learning. They can
> find their way to significant places.
>
> An import ant kind of place, made intel ligible by the ecological approach to visual perception,
> is a place that affords conceal ment, a hiding place. Note that it involves social perception and
> raises questions of epistemology. The conceal ing of oneself from other observers and the hiding
> of a detached object from other observers have different kinds of motivation. As every child
> discovers, a good hiding place for one’s body is not necessar ily a good hiding place for a treas
> ure. A detached object can be concealed both from other observers and from the observer
> himself. The observer’s body can be concealed from other observers but not from himself, as the
> last chapter emphasized. Animals as well as children hide themselves and also hide objects such as
> food. (s. 127-128)
