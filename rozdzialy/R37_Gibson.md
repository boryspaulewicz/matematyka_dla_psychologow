# Top pięć ćwiczeń ze spóźnionego czytania ze zrozumieniem - numer siedem - Gibson

Pierwszy raz zajrzałem do wydanego kiedy miałem roczek *The Ecological Approach to Visual
Perception* Gibsona jakiś tydzień albo dwa tygodnie temu. A więc siedem miesięcy po tym, jak
zacząłem pisać tą książkę, a dwadzieścia lat po tym, jak zacząłem pisać pracę doktorską dotyczącą
teoretycznych podstaw psychologii, w której od pewnego momentu opierałem się głównie na obserwacji,
że każde zachowanie jako takie to działanie celowe, a każde działanie celowe jako takie jest
przybliżonym rozwiązaniem jakiegoś zadania, wobec czego psychologia naukowa powinna polegać przede
wszystkim na rozwijaniu teorii ogólnych własności zadań.

Od tego czasu miałem dokładnie dwa równie dobre moim zdaniem wglądy, to jest obserwację, że dla
psychologa środowisko jest układem powiązanych zadań i niedawny wgląd, że funkcje rozumiane jako
role w rozwiązaniach zadań są z konieczności relatywne do punktu widzenia i nieunikalne.

I teraz nie wiem, czy źle się stało, że do Gibsona zajrzałem tak późno, czy może jednak to
spóźnienie nie było wcale takie złe.

## *Introduction*:

> In this book, *environment* will refer to the surroundings of those organisms that perceive and
> behave, that is to say, animals. 

Już w roku 1979 można było zauważyć, że adaptują się, uczą, zachowują i działają celowo nie tylko
zwierzęta, a poza tym nie da się zachowywać nie reagując na jakieś źródło informacji, a więc
wystarczyłoby *behave* (może jako to, co robią powiedzmy jakieś *physical processes*), ale to i tak
znacznie lepsze pierwsze zdanie wprowadzenia do książki dotyczącej psychologii niż wiele innych tego
rodzaju zdań.

> The environment of plants, organisms that lack sense organs and muscles, is not relevant in the
> study of perception and behavior.

Fajnie, ale dlaczego?

> We shall treat the vegetation of the world as animals do, as if it were lumped together with the
> inorganic minerals of the world, with the physical, chemical, and geological environment. Plants
> in general are not animate; they do not move about, they do not behave, they lack a nervous
> system, and they do not have sensations. In these respects they are like the objects of physics,
> chemistry, and geology.

Jasne, rośliny nie mają układu nerwowego, ale układ nerwowy nie jest warunkiem koniecznym
zachowania. A o "wrażeniach" roślin możemy przypuszczać, że nie pewnie nie istnieją jako własności
subiektywnego doświadczenia, ale jako funkcjonalne wejścia informacyjne - czemu nie?

> Biology begins with the division between the nonliving and the living. But psychology begins with
> the division between the inanimate and the animate, and this is where we choose to begin.

I znowu pudło, ale imponująco blisko. Biologia zajmuje się życiem, a psychologia zajmuje się
celowością.

> The environment consists of the *surroundings* of animals. Let us observe that in one sense the
> surroundings of a single animal are the same as the surroundings of all animals but that in
> another sense the surroundings of a single animal are different from those of any other
> animal. (s. 3)

Ponieważ różne zwierzęta obchodzą różne rzeczy, a środowisko jako przedmiot i zarazem strefa
zachowania to konstelacja powiązanych zadań.

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *The Mutuality of Animal and Environment*:

> The fact is worth remembering because it is often neglected that the words *animal* and
> *environment* make an inseparable pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without
> an environment surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environment implies an animal
> (or at least an organism) to be surrounded.

Niezupełnie, bo terminu "środowisko" używamy między innymi również na określenie fizycznego
otoczenia obiektów fizycznych. Ale ponieważ Gibsonowi chodzi tutaj ewidentnie o środowisko rozumiane
jako coś w rodzaju sfery adaptacji zwierząt - dlatego mówi później, że *środowisko "implikuje"
organizm* - możemy popatrzeć na to stwierdzenie życzliwym okiem.

> The mutuality of animal and environment is not implied by physics and the physical sciences.

Zwracam uwagę, jak subtelną rolę odgrywa w tym i poprzednim fragmencie czasownik "to imply", czyli
*implikować*, *pociągać za sobą*, albo *sugerować*.

> The basic concepts of space, time, matter, and energy do not lead naturally to the
> organism-environment concept or to the concept of a species and its habitat.

Lepiej, bo ogólniej i trafiając w sedno: Żaden sąd normatywny nie wynika z samych sądów opisowych.

> Instead, they seem to lead to the idea of an animal as an extremely complex object of the physical
> world. The animal is thought of as a highly organized *part* of the physical world but still a
> part and still an object. This way of thinking neglects the fact that the animal-object is
> surrounded in a special way, that an environment is ambient for a living object in a different way
> from the way that a set of objects is ambient for a physical object. The term *physical
> environment* is, therefore, apt to get us mixed up, and it will usually be avoided in this book.

Gibson, chłopie, byłeś tak blisko!

> Every animal is, in some degree at least, a perceiver and a behaver. It is sentient and animate,
> to use old-fashioned terms. It is a perceiver *of* the environment and a behaver *in* the
> environment. But this is not to say that it perceives the world of physics and behaves in the
> space and time of physics. (s. 4)

Lepiej, bo ogólniej i trafiając w sedno: Nie ma czegoś takiego jak zachowanie, które nie korzysta z
jakiegoś źródła informacji przybliżając jakiś cel.

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Units of the Environment*:

> Now, with respect to these units, an essential point of theory must be emphasized. The smaller
> units are embedded in the larger units by what I will call *nesting*. For example, canyons are
> nested within mountains; trees are nested within canyons; leaves are nested within trees; and
> cells are nested within leaves. There are forms within forms both up and down the scale of
> size. Units are nested within larger units. Things are components of other things. They would
> constitute a hierarchy except that this hierarchy is not categorical but full of transitions and
> overlaps. Hence, for the terrestrial environment, there is no special proper unit in terms of
> which it can be analyzed once and for all. There are no atomic units of the world considered as an
> environment. Instead, there are subordinate and superordinate units. (s. 5)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *The Time Scale of the Environment: Events*:

> The acts of animals themselves, like the events of the environment they perceive, can be described
> at various levels, as subordinate and superordinate acts. (s. 8)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Permanence and Change of the Layout*:

> An observer can recognize the same room on different occasions while perceiving the change of
> arrangement, or the same child at different ages while noticing her growth. The permanence
> underlies the change.
>
> Permanence is relative, of course; that is, it depends on whether you mean persistence over a day,
> a year, or a millennium. Almost nothing is forever permanent; nothing is either immutable or
> mutable. So it is better to speak of *persistence* under change. The "permanent objects" of the
> world, which are of so much concern to psychologists and philosophers, are actually only objects
> that persist for a very long time.
>
> The abstract notion of invariance and variance in mathematics is related to what is meant by
> persistence and change in the environment. There are variants and invariants in any
> transformation, constants and variables. Some properties are conserved and others not
> conserved. The same words are not used by all writers (for example, Piaget, 1969), but there is a
> common core of meaning in all such pairs of terms. The point to be noted is that for persistence
> and change, for invariant and variant, each term of the pair is reciprocal to the other. (s. 8-9)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Persistence in the Environment*:

> The same would be true if a shaped object disintegrated, changing from solid to granular. The
> object does not persist, but the matter does. Ecology calls this a *nonpersistence*, a destruction
> of the object, whereas physics calls it a mere *change of state*. Both assertions are correct, but
> the former is more relevant to the behavior of animals and children. (s. 9)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Motion in the Environment*:

> So different, in fact, are environmental motions from those studied by Isaac Newton that it is
> best to think of them as changes of structure rather than changes of position of elementary
> bodies, changes of form rather than of point locations, or changes in the layout rather than
> motions in the usual meaning of the term. (s. 10)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *The Animal and the Environment* / *Summary*:

> The environment of animals and men is what they perceive. The environment is not the same as the
> physical world, if one means by that the world described by physics.
>
> The observer and his environment are complementary. So are the set of observers and their common
> environment.
>
> The components and events of the environment fall into natural units. These units are
> nested. They should not be confused with the metric units of space and time.
>
> The environment persists in some respects and changes in other respects. The most radical change
> is going out of existence or coming into existence. (s. 11)

## *The Environment to be Perceived* / *Medium, Substances, Surfaces* / *The Properties of the Atmosphere*:

> To sum up, the characteristics of an environmental medium are that it affords respiration or
> breathing; it permits locomotion; it can be filled with illumination so as to permit vision; it
> allows detection of vibrations and detection of diffusing emanations; it is homogeneous; and
> finally, it has an absolute axis of reference, up and down. All these offerings of nature, these
> possibilities or opportunities, these *affordances* as I will call them, are invariant. They have
> been strikingly constant throughout the whole evolution of animal life. (s. 14-15)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances*:

> I have described the environment as the surfaces that separate substances from the medium in which
> the animals live. But I have also described what the environment *affords* animals, mentioning the
> terrain, shelters, water, fire, objects, tools, other animals, and human displays. How do we go
> from surfaces to affordances? And if there is information in light for the perception of surfaces,
> is there information for the perception of what they afford? Perhaps the composition and layout of
> surfaces *constitute* what they afford. If so, to perceive them is to perceive what they
> afford. This is a radical hypothesis, for it implies that the "values" and "meanings" of things in
> the environment can be directly perceived. Moreover, it would explain the sense in which values
> and meanings are external to the perceiver.
>
> The *affordances* of the environment are what it *offers* the animal, what it *provides* or
> *furnishes*, either for good or ill. The verb *to afford* is found in the dictionary, but the noun
> *affordance* is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment
> and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complemxuntarity of the animal
> and the environment.

> If a terrestrial surface is nearly horizontal (instead of slanted), nearly flat (instead of convex
> or concave), and sufficiently extended (relative to the size of the animal) and if its substance
> is rigid (relative to the weight of the animal), then the surface *affords support*. It is a
> surface of support, and we call it a substratum, ground, or floor. It is stand-on-able, permitting
> an upright posture for quadrupeds and bipeds. It is therefore walk-on-able and run-over-able. It
> is not sink-into-able like a surface of water or a swamp, that is, not for heavy terrestrial
> animals. Support for water bugs is different.
>
> Note that the four properties listed - horizontal, flat, extended, and rigid - would be *physical*
> properties of a surface if they were measured with the scales and standard units used in
> physics. As an affordance of support for a species of animal, however, they have to be measured
> *relative to the animal*. They are unique for that animal. They are not just abstract physical
> properties. They have unity relative to the posture and behavior of the animal being considered.
> So an affordance cannot be measured as we measure in physics. (s. 119-120)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *The Niches of the Environment*:

> Ecologists have the concept of a *niche*. A species of animal is said to utilize or occupy a
> certain niche in the environment. This is not quite the same as the habitat of the species; a
> niche refers more to *how* an animal lives than to *where* it lives. I suggest that a niche is a
> set of affordances.
>
> The natural environment offers many ways of life, and different animals have different ways of
> life. The niche implies a kind of animal, and the animal implies a kind of niche. Note the
> complementarity of the two. (s. 120)

> An important fact about the affordances of the environment is that they are in a sense objective,
> real, and physical, unlike values and meanings, which are often supposed to be subjective,
> phenomenal, and mental. But, actually, an affordance is neither an objective property nor a
> subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of
> subjective-objective and helps us to under stand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the
> environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance
> points both ways, to the environment and to the observer.
>
> The niche for a certain species should not be confused with what some animal psychologists have
> called the *phenomenal environment* of the species. This can be taken erroneously to be the
> "private world" in which the species is supposed to live, the "subject ive world," or the world of
> "consciousness." The behavior of observers depends on their perception of the environment, surely
> enough, but this does not mean that their behavior depends on a so-called private or subjective or
> conscious environment. The organism depends on its environ mentfor its life, but the environment
> does not depend on the organism for its existence. (s. 121)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Man's Alteration of the Natural Environment*:

> In the last few thousand years, as everybody now realizes, the very face of the earth has been
> modified by man. (s. 121)

> Why has man changed the shapes and substances of his environment? To change what it affords
> him. He has made more available what benefits him and less pressing what injures him. In making
> life easier for himself, of course, he has made life harder for most of the other animals. Over
> the millennia, he has made it easier for himself to get food, easier to keep warm, easier to see
> at night, easier to get about, and easier to train his offspring.
>
> This is not a *new* environment - an artificial environment distinct from the natural
> environment - but the same old environment modified by man. It is a mistake to separate the
> natural from the artificial as if there were two environments; artifacts have to be manufactured
> from natural substances. It is also a mistake to separate the cultural environment from the
> natural environment, as if there were a world of mental products distinct from the world of
> material products. There is only one world, however diverse, and all animals live in it, although
> we human animals have altered it to suit ourselves. We have done so wastefully, thoughtlessly,
> and, if we do not mend our ways, fatally. (s. 122)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Some Affordances of the Terrestrial Environment* / *The Objects*:

> Orthodox psychology asserts that *we perceive these objects insofar as we discriminate their
> properties or qualities*. Psychologists carry out elegant experiments in the laboratory to find
> out how and how well these qualities are discriminated. The psychologists assume that objects are
> *composed* of their qualities. But I now suggest that what we perceive when we look at objects are
> their affordances, not their qualities. We can discriminate the dimensions of difference if
> required to do so in an experiment, but what the object affords us is what we normally pay
> attention to. The special combination of qualities into which an object can be analyzed is
> ordinarily not noticed.

> [...] Phenomenal objects are *not* built up of qualities; it is the other way around. The
> affordance of an object is what the infant begins by noticing. The meaning is observed before the
> substance and surface, the color and form, are seen as such. An affordance is an invariant
> combination of variables, and one might guess that it is easier to perceive such an invariant unit
> than it is to perceive all the variables separately. It is never necessary to distinguish *all*
> the features of an object and, in fact, it would be impossible to do so. Perception is
> economical. (s. 125-126)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *To Perceive an Affordance is not to Classify an Object*:

> The fact that a stone is a missile does not imply that it cannot be other things as well. It can
> be a paperweight, a bookend, a hammer, or a pendulum bob. It can be piled on another rock to make
> a cairn or a stone wall. These affordances are all consistent with one another. The differences
> between them are not clear-cut, and the arbitrary names by which they are called do not count for
> perception. If you know what can be done with a graspable detached object, what it can be used
> for, you can call it whatever you please.
>
> The theory of affordances rescues us from the philosophical muddle of assuming fixed classes of
> objects, each defined by its common features and then given a name. As Ludwig Wittgenstein knew,
> you *cannot* specify the necessary and sufficient features of the class of things to which a name
> is given. They have only a "family resemblance." But this does not mean you cannot learn how to
> use things and perceive their uses. You do not have to classify and label things in order to
> perceive what they afford. (s. 126)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Other Persons and Animals*:

> The richest and most elaborate affordances of the environment are provided by other animals and,
> for us, other people. These are, of course, detached objects with topologically closed surfaces,
> but they change the shape of their surfaces while yet retaining the same fundamental shape. They
> move from place to place, changing the postures of their bodies, ingesting and emitting certain
> substances, and doing all this spontaneously, initiating their own movements, which is to say that
> their movements are *animate*. These bodies are subject to the laws of mechanics and yet *not*
> subject to the laws of mechanics, for they are not *governed* by these laws. They are so different
> from ordinary objects that infants learn almost immediately to distinguish them from plants and
> nonliving things. When touched they touch back, when struck they strike back; in short, they
> *interact* with the observer and with one another. Behavior affords behavior, and the whole
> subject matter of psychology and of the social sciences can be thought of as an elaboration of
> this basic fact. Sexual behavior, nurturing behavior, fighting behavior, cooperative behavior,
> economic behavior, political behavior all depend on the perceiving of what another person or other
> persons afford, or sometimes on the misperceiving of it. (s. 126-127)

## *The Information for Visual Perception* / *The Theory of Affordances* / *Places and Hiding Places*

> The habitat of a given animal contains *places*. A place is not an object with definite boundaries
> but a region (Chapter 3). The different places of a habitat may have different affordances. Some
> are places where food is usually found and others where it is not. There are places of danger,
> such as the brink of a cliff and the regions where predators lurk. There are places of refuge from
> predators. Among these is the place where mate and young are, the home, which is usually a partial
> enclosure. Animals are skilled at what the psychologist calls place-learning. They can find their
> way to significant places.
>
> An important kind of place, made intelligible by the ecological approach to visual perception, is
> a place that affords concealment, a *hiding place*. Note that it involves social perception and
> raises questions of epistemology. The concealing of oneself from other observers and the hiding of
> a detached object from other observers have different kinds of motivation. As every child
> discovers, a good hiding place for one's body is not necessarily a good hiding place for a
> treasure. A detached object can be concealed both from other observers and from the observer
> himself. The observer's body can be concealed from other observers but *not* from himself, as the
> last chapter emphasized. Animals as well as children hide themselves and also hide objects such as
> food. (s. 127-128)
